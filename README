Building bitbit
---------------
Run

	make

in the root directory. Make can be run with the following command

	make TT={n} SIMD={str} NNUE={file}

to specify a transposition table size, available SIMD instructions
and an NNUE filename respectively. TT={n} gives a transposition
table of 2^n bytes. The default value of n is 26 which corresponds
to a 64MiB transposition table. Available targets for SIMD={str}
are avx2, sse4 and sse2 in decreasing order of performance.
