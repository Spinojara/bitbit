- Add checks for malloc.
- Aspiration window should probably return VALUE_NONE if interrupted.
- Grain evaluation for better move ordering etc.
- Rook and knight pair penalties.
- Test for integer overflows using clang in real games.
- Make unit tests for mevalue_mg etc.
- Unfinished search.
- Check histogram to see which endgames where a material difference >= 3 are drawn.
  Add most of these endgames to the endgame database.
- Observed draw with KRRKR which should never happen. This is probably because
  endgame value is less than middle game value and bitbit refuses to trade. If we
  manually increase the endgame values above the middle game values and then tune
  this will most likely be resolved.
- Add KBPK endgame. This is only lost if the pawn promotes on a corner and this
  corner is the opposite color of the bishop. We can maybe use the KPK bitbase to
  evaluate this corner.
- Add KRNKR endgame which seems drawn.
- Bonus for king in endgame being close to pawns.
- The winning side should maybe get a bonus for having kings close to each other.
  This is actually important for mate finding in weird situations like KQKNN if
  there is a possible mate.
- Does search have the same repetition problem that we encountered when generating
  the KPK bitbase? This could potentially lead to some funny things. The problem
  occurs when storing a value scored as a repetition in the transposition table.
  This position may or may not be a repetition when encountered the next time.
- Is it possible to fix that make does not rebuild when we update variables like
  DEBUG=2 or NNUE=file?
- Should all inlined functions be static inline etc?
- Don't use BUFSIZ.

VERY IMPORTANT
- Verify that the new transposition table works correctly.
