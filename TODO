- Add checks for malloc.
- Aspiration window should probably return VALUE_NONE if interrupted.
- Make the enums upper case. pawn -> PAWN etc.
- Make the shift functions take an argument from an
  enum { NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST }; This should probably be as fast as
  shift_north etc since the functions are inlined. Check the generated assembly.
  Probably better with enum { UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT }; These should also be so
  that square + dir is the expected square (for white). That is UP = 8 etc.
- Try pgnbin but don't consider pawn captures with --quiet option.
- Use offsetof instead of partialposition.
- Try pgo (profile guided optimization).
- Profile code using gcov, operf and gprof.

VERY IMPORTANT
- Verify that the new transposition table works correctly.
- Verify that the new static exchange evaluation works correctly.
