- Add checks for malloc.
- Aspiration window should probably return VALUE_NONE if interrupted.
- Grain evaluation for better move ordering etc.
- Rook and knight pair penalties.
- Test for integer overflows using clang in real games.
- Make unit tests for mevalue_mg etc.
- Use int for ply and depth.
- Unfinished search.
- Check histogram to see which endgames where a material difference >= 3 are drawn.
  Add most of these endgames to the endgame database.
- Observed draw with KRRKR which should never happen. This is probably because
  endgame value is less than middle game value and bitbit refuses to trade. If we
  manually increase the endgame values above the middle game values and then tune
  this will most likely be resolved.
- Add KBPK endgame. This is only lost if the pawn promotes on a corner and this
  corner is the opposite color of the bishop.
- Add KRNKR endgame which seems drawn.
- Bonus for king in endgame being close to pawns. The winning site should maybe
  get a bonus for having kings close to each other.
