- Add checks for malloc.
- Aspiration window should probably return VALUE_NONE if interrupted.
- Try pgnbin but don't consider pawn captures with --quiet option.
- Use offsetof instead of partialposition.
- Try pgo (profile guided optimization).
- Profile code using gcov, operf and gprof.

VERY IMPORTANT
- Verify that the new transposition table works correctly.
- Verify that the new static exchange evaluation works correctly.
