- Add checks for malloc.
- Aspiration window should probably return VALUE_NONE if interrupted.
- Test for integer overflows using clang in real games.
- Make unit tests for score_mg etc.
- Unfinished search.
- The winning side should maybe get a bonus for having kings close to each other.
  This is actually important for mate finding in weird situations like KQKNN if
  there is a possible mate.
- Does search have the same repetition problem that we encountered when generating
  the KPK bitbase? This could potentially lead to some funny things. The problem
  occurs when storing a value scored as a repetition in the transposition table.
  This position may or may not be a repetition when encountered the next time.
- Is it possible to fix that make does not rebuild when we update variables like
  DEBUG=2 or NNUE=file?
- Should all inlined functions be static inline etc?
- Don't use BUFSIZ.
- Make the enums upper case. pawn -> PAWN etc.
- Make the shift functions take an argument from an
  enum { NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST }; This should probably be as fast as
  shift_north etc since the functions are inlined. Check the generated assembly.
  Probably better with enum { UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT }; These should also be so
  that square + dir is the expected square (for white). That is UP = 8 etc.
- Make a contributions page.
- Try pgnbin but don't consider pawn captures with --quiet option.

VERY IMPORTANT
- Verify that the new transposition table works correctly.
- Verify that the new static exchange evaluation works correctly.
